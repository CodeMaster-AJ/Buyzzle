# Buyzzle E-commerce Platform

## Overview

Buyzzle is a modern full-stack e-commerce application built by TEAM AJ with University Incubation Centre support. The application features a React frontend with TypeScript, an Express.js backend, and uses PostgreSQL with Drizzle ORM for data management. It's designed as a comprehensive e-commerce platform with product catalog, shopping cart functionality, user feedback system, and admin dashboard capabilities.

## System Architecture

### Frontend Architecture
- **Framework**: React 18 with TypeScript
- **Routing**: Wouter for lightweight client-side routing
- **State Management**: TanStack Query (React Query) for server state management
- **UI Components**: Radix UI primitives with custom shadcn/ui components
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with CSS custom properties for theming
- **Build Tool**: Vite for fast development and optimized builds

### Backend Architecture
- **Runtime**: Node.js with Express.js server
- **Language**: TypeScript with ES modules
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with Drizzle ORM
- **Database Provider**: Neon serverless PostgreSQL
- **Session Management**: Express sessions with PostgreSQL store
- **API Design**: RESTful API endpoints under `/api` namespace

### Development Environment
- **Platform**: Replit with Node.js 20, web, and PostgreSQL 16 modules
- **Development Server**: Runs on port 5000 with Vite dev server integration
- **Hot Reloading**: Enabled for both frontend and backend development

## Key Components

### Database Schema
Located in `shared/schema.ts`, defines four main entities:
- **Users**: Authentication and user management (id, username, password, email, role, timestamps)
- **Products**: Product catalog (id, name, description, price, category, imageUrl, stock, featured, active, timestamps)
- **Feedback**: Customer feedback system (id, name, email, subject, message, timestamp)
- **CartItems**: Shopping cart functionality (id, userId, productId, quantity, timestamp)

### Frontend Pages
- **Home**: Landing page with hero section, featured products, and category showcase
- **Products**: Product catalog with search, filtering, and pagination
- **About**: Team information and company background
- **Contact**: Feedback form for customer inquiries
- **Admin Login**: Authentication for administrative access
- **Admin Dashboard**: Product and order management interface

### API Endpoints
- **Products**: CRUD operations, search, category filtering, featured products
- **Feedback**: Customer inquiry submission
- **Cart**: Shopping cart management
- **Admin**: Administrative functions and dashboard data

### UI Components
- Custom product cards with cart integration
- Search bar with debounced queries
- Responsive navigation with mobile menu
- Theme provider for dark/light mode switching
- Reusable form components with validation

## Data Flow

1. **Client Requests**: Frontend makes API calls using TanStack Query
2. **Server Processing**: Express.js handles requests and validates data using Zod schemas
3. **Database Operations**: Drizzle ORM executes SQL queries against PostgreSQL
4. **Response Handling**: Data flows back through the API to update React components
5. **State Management**: TanStack Query manages caching, background updates, and error states

## External Dependencies

### Frontend Dependencies
- **UI Framework**: React, TypeScript, Vite
- **UI Components**: Radix UI primitives, Lucide React icons
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS, class-variance-authority for component variants
- **Forms**: React Hook Form with Zod validation
- **State**: TanStack Query for server state
- **Routing**: Wouter for client-side navigation

### Backend Dependencies
- **Server**: Express.js with TypeScript support
- **Database**: Drizzle ORM, Neon serverless PostgreSQL
- **Validation**: Zod for schema validation
- **Sessions**: connect-pg-simple for PostgreSQL session store
- **Development**: tsx for TypeScript execution, esbuild for production builds

### Development Tools
- **Build**: Vite with React plugin
- **Database**: Drizzle Kit for migrations and schema management
- **Linting**: TypeScript compiler for type checking
- **Replit Integration**: Runtime error overlay and cartographer plugins

## Deployment Strategy

### Development Mode
- Runs on Replit with `npm run dev` command
- Uses tsx to execute TypeScript server code directly
- Vite dev server serves frontend with hot module replacement
- PostgreSQL database provisioned through Replit

### Production Build
- Frontend built with `npm run build` using Vite
- Backend bundled with esbuild for Node.js deployment  
- Static files served from `dist/public` directory
- Runs on port 5000 with autoscale deployment target

### Environment Configuration
- Database connection via `DATABASE_URL` environment variable
- Neon serverless PostgreSQL with WebSocket support
- Session configuration for production security
- CORS and security headers for production deployment
